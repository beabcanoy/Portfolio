### About Me
  Hi, my name is Beverly A. Canoy. A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology graduate majoring in System Development, with hands-on experience in software testing through internship and freelance projects. Skilled in manual and automated testing of web, mobile, and API applications using tools such as Selenium, Robot Framework, Cypress, and Postman. Experienced in writing test cases, executing regression tests, reporting bugs with Jira/GitLab, and collaborating in Agile teams. Detail-oriented and eager to contribute to delivering high-quality software products while continuing to grow as a QA professional.

### My Experience
  During my internship at Fligno, I performed manual, regression, and automated testing for both web and mobile applications. I designed and executed test cases while tracking and reporting defects using GitLab and JIRA. I also conducted load testing using JMeter and automated functional test scripts with Selenium and Robot Framework, improving overall test efficiency. Additionally, I collaborated closely with developers during daily stand-ups and sprint reviews to quickly identify and resolve issues.
